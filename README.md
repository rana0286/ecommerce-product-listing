- npm run test to run the unit test with eslint and sass-lint check
- npm run lint for JavaScript/React linting
- npm run sass-lint for sass linting


## Architecure and principle
- I follow the atomic design patteren
- For good scalability, reusability and unit testing I used "single responsibility principle"
- I used DRY(Do not repeat) principle
- It is a single page app developed using react/redux
- Sepration of concern

## Tools and Technology
- Webpack 4 and Babel 7 for build and transpiler
- Redux for state management and redux-thunk as a middleware
- React as a view library
- Jest and enzyme for unit testing
- eslint for JavaScript linting
- sass-lint for sass linting
- scss to write the css with BEM convention
- Node v10 for build and automation

## Code quality
- sass lint issue 0
- eslint issue 0 (On cuurrent config of eslint)
- Components unit test coverage is 95%
- pre commit hooks (using husky) to run linting and unit test cases

## Further Improvements
- Handle errors and exceptions from single place
- i18n
- Performance check
- Accessibility check
- Integration (BDD)
- CI/CD implementation
- Can be us styled-components

## Why not SSR
- No black and white distiction between SSR and CSR
- Pros and cons of CSR and SRR are debatable
